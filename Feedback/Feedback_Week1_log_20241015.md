# Feedback on Project Structure and Code

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization
The repository is well-organized, following a clear structure with separate directories for `code`, `data`, and `results`. This layout makes it easy to understand where different elements of the project reside. However, the absence of a `.gitignore` file is noticeable. Including a `.gitignore` file would prevent unnecessary files from being tracked, such as temporary or system files.

### README Files
The main `README.md` provides a concise overview of the repository, detailing its purpose and structure. It could be enhanced by adding instructions on how to run the scripts, as well as including dependencies or setup steps in more detail. The Week1 `README` provides context about the course material, but similarly, more detailed instructions on how to run the scripts would be useful for external users or collaborators.

## Workflow
The workflow adheres to good practices by keeping code, data, and results separate. The results directory is empty, which is ideal since generated outputs should not be stored in version control. However, it might be useful to include instructions in the `README.md` on how results are generated and where they are stored after the scripts are run.

## Code Syntax & Structure

### Shell Scripts
1. **Variables.sh:**
   - The script effectively demonstrates variable usage, but the arithmetic operation using `expr` is outdated. Replace `expr` with:
     ```bash
     MY_SUM=$(($a + $b))
     ```
   - This will improve readability and compatibility with modern shell scripting practices.

2. **CsvToSpace.sh:**
   - The script converts CSV files to space-separated files. It handles input validation well, checking for file existence and proper extension. The error messages are informative, though spelling errors such as "seperated" (should be "separated") should be corrected.

3. **Boilerplate.sh:**
   - This script runs as expected and functions as a simple shell script template. It would be helpful to add a brief comment explaining the use of `-e` in `echo`.

4. **Tiff2Png.sh:**
   - The script attempts to convert `.tif` files to `.png`. It encounters an error when no `.tif` files are present. Adding a check for `.tif` files before running the `convert` command would prevent this error. Also, ensure that the `ImageMagick` tool is available on the system before running the script.

5. **UnixPrac1.txt:**
   - This script efficiently processes `.fasta` files, performing tasks like counting lines, computing ATGC ratios, and more. Adding detailed comments explaining each step, particularly the more complex `find` and `awk` commands, would improve readability and maintainability.

6. **TabToCsv.sh:**
   - The script converts tab-delimited files to CSV. Input validation is well-handled, and it correctly outputs to a `.csv` file. A minor issue is the spelling of "Creaing," which should be corrected to "Creating."

7. **MyExampleScript.sh:**
   - The script works as expected but has a small issue: the variable `$user` should be `$USER` to correctly reference the environment variable for the current user.

8. **ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh:**
   - This script merges two input files into a third output file. It includes proper input validation, but it would be useful to check if the output file already exists to prevent overwriting files unintentionally.

9. **Countlines.sh:**
   - The script counts the number of lines in a file and handles input validation well. No major issues were encountered, but as with other scripts, consider checking if the output file exists before writing to avoid overwriting.

### LaTeX Files
1. **FirstExample.tex & FirstBiblio.bib:**
   - Both files are well-formatted. The LaTeX file is clear and follows proper structure. No issues were encountered with these files.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- **Error Handling:** Across several scripts, adding checks to prevent overwriting files or dealing with missing input files would improve robustness.
- **Command Substitution:** Replace backticks (`) with `$(command)` for better readability and portability.
- **Spelling:** Correct minor spelling errors (e.g., "seperated" to "separated").
- **Comments:** Adding more detailed comments, especially in scripts like `UnixPrac1.txt`, would help clarify the purpose of certain commands for less experienced users.

## Overall Feedback
The project structure is well-organized, and the scripts are functional. The use of input validation is consistent and effective. By improving error handling, adding more detailed comments, and modernizing some of the scripting practices, the project would be even more robust and user-friendly. Overall, it demonstrates a good understanding of shell scripting and workflow organization.
