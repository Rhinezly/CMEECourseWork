# Feedback on Project Structure, Workflow, and Python Code

## Project Structure and Workflow

### General Structure
- **Directory Organization**: The project structure follows a clear pattern, with separate folders like `code`, `data`, `results`, and `sandbox`. This layout helps in maintaining order in the repository. It is good practice to exclude the `results` directory from version control if it is only used for outputs, which can be regenerated by scripts, or keep it empty, but with a `.gitkeep`.
- **.gitignore**: The `.gitignore` file effectively excludes unnecessary files like `*.csv`, `*.txt`, and `*.md` but still allows tracking critical code files. However, consider adding files such as `__pycache__`, `*.pkl`, and temporary files from the `sandbox/` folder to further optimize this list.
- **README Files**: 
  - The main `README.md` file provides an overview of the repository, including instructions on running Python and bash scripts, which is useful.
  - The Week2 `README.md` explains the weekly directory structure and provides command-line examples for script execution. Adding specific details about required Python versions or modules (like `ipdb`, `pickle`) and their installation via a `requirements.txt` file could improve the setup process for other users.
  - The **Usage** section would benefit from including sample commands with expected inputs and outputs for various scripts, especially those taking arguments from the command line (e.g., `align_seqs_fasta.py`).

### Workflow
- **Results Directory**: Currently, the results directory is missing and gets created during the assessment process. It would be good to ensure this directory exists or is created dynamically by the code when required to avoid issues during runtime.
- **Code Locations**: The project contains multiple directories with related files, such as `week1`, `week2`, and `week3`. This layout is efficient for weekly assignments. However, ensure that any code or scripts not directly related to the current week's assignment are not included within the `week2` folder to maintain clarity.

## Python Code Feedback

### General Code Quality
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Overall, the code adheres to Python standards. However, there are minor spacing and indentation inconsistencies that could be improved to enhance readability and maintain PEP 8 compliance.
- **Docstrings**: Several scripts and functions lack comprehensive docstrings. Every function and script should include detailed docstrings to explain the input parameters, return values, and overall functionality. This will improve clarity, especially for users not familiar with the codebase.
- **Error Handling**: Many scripts assume that files exist in specific directories without validating this first. Adding checks for file existence, proper formatting, and error handling for unexpected input would make the code more robust.

### Detailed Code Review

#### `cfexercises1.py`
- **Control Flow Functions**: The functions demonstrating control flows (e.g., `foo_5`, `foo_6`) are well-written but contain some redundancy. For example, both `foo_5` and `foo_6` calculate factorials, but with different approaches. These could be refactored to improve readability and remove duplication.
- **Docstrings**: Ensure every function has a docstring to describe its purpose and inputs.

#### `cfexercises2.py`
- **Control Statements**: The script has a series of control flow examples using loops and conditionals. It runs well, but docstrings are completely missing for each function and the script as a whole. Adding comments and explanations to describe the logic would improve clarity.

#### `align_seqs_fasta.py`
- **Modularization**: The sequence alignment logic works, but could benefit from being broken into smaller, reusable functions. This will make the script easier to maintain and debug.
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding exception handling for scenarios where the FASTA input files are missing or incorrectly formatted.

#### `oaks_debugme.py`
- **Doctests**: The embedded doctests for the `is_an_oak` function are useful for checking functionality. However, more edge cases could be tested to make sure the function works as expected for a wider range of inputs.
- **Error Handling**: This script assumes the presence of certain input files without validating them first. Adding checks for file existence would make the code more robust.

#### `align_seqs_better.py`
- **Binary Output**: The script attempts to save results to a binary file, but if the directory structure is not created correctly (e.g., the `results/` directory is missing), it throws a `FileNotFoundError`. Adding error handling for file I/O operations would prevent such issues.

#### `basic_io1.py`, `basic_io2.py`, and `basic_io3.py`
- **File Handling**: These scripts demonstrate basic file I/O operations, but they lack proper error handling and do not ensure the files are closed correctly. Using Python’s `with open()` context manager would ensure files are closed even if an error occurs during execution.
- **Docstrings**: There are no script-level docstrings to explain the purpose of each script. Adding these would improve code clarity.

#### `dictionary.py`
- **Optimization**: The dictionary creation code works but could be optimized using Python’s `defaultdict` from the `collections` module for improved performance and readability.

#### `debugme.py`
- **Error Handling**: The `buggyfunc` function effectively demonstrates debugging techniques but could benefit from more explicit error handling, especially for edge cases beyond division by zero.
- **Docstrings**: Missing docstrings make it harder for users to understand the function’s purpose and how it behaves under different scenarios.

### Final Remarks
The project demonstrates a solid grasp of Python basics, including control flow, file handling, and list comprehensions. However, it could be improved by:
1. Ensuring all functions and scripts have detailed docstrings.
2. Adding more robust error handling for file operations and input validation.
3. Refactoring redundant code to improve efficiency and readability.
