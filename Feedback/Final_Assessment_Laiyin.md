# Final CMEE Bootcamp Assessment: Laiyin Zhou

### Overall

You did *not* follow instructions - all your work was within a `Bootcamp` directory!

## Week 1

  - A detailed README file was provided, covering dependencies and general usage instructions.
  - Directories (`code`, `data`, and `results`) were present as expected.
  - `.gitignore` was missing in Week 1, leading to potential clutter in the repository.
  - Weekly README files could include more specific instructions or outputs for better clarity.
  - Bash scripts (`csvtospace.sh`, `variables.sh`) were functional but needed additional error handling and inline comments.

## Week 2
  - `.gitignore` was added, demonstrating improved repository management.
  - Scripts in the `code` directory showed better organization, and results directories were correctly left empty.
  - While the README was more detailed, specific script descriptions (e.g., inputs, outputs) were lacking.
  - Results files such as `my_best_match` were not properly handled, leading to script errors.
  - You could have formatted the output of certain scripts to be a little neater/organised/informative -- for example `lc1.py` is perfectly functional, but the output could have been improved (compare with my solution). `dictionary.py` had no output!
  - Python scripts such as `align_seqs.py` demonstrated some modularity but still scope for improvement.
  - `oaks_debugme.py` was OK.

## Week 3
  - Dependencies for R scripts were listed, showing attention to detail in documentation.
  - Missing inline comments in some R scripts reduced readability.
  - Intermediate outputs were left in the `results` directory, which should ideally remain empty unless explicitly required.
  - Weekly READMEs still lacked detailed explanations of individual scripts.

## Week 4
  - README for the Florida practical included a summary of tasks and instructions - good.
  - README could benefit from troubleshooting tips or examples of expected results for key scripts.
  - Your Autocorrelation practicals were OK, with some tweaks needed - please compare your p-value calculations with the solutions provided. The code was succinct and it was reasonably efficient . Include inline comments to explain the purpose of each statistical test.
  - "confidence interval" is no what the embedded plot shows (and fitting a linear regression is not justified)
  - Your statistical and biological/ecological interpretations could have been more succinct / insightful. The report's conclusion was somewhat ambiguous at the end.
  - Your Groupwork practicals were all in order, and your group did OK in collaborating  - have a look at my group-specific feedback (already pushed to the git repo).

## Git Practices

- Commits improved over time, with more descriptive messages in later weeks.
- `.gitignore` was updated to exclude unnecessary files, improving repository hygiene.
- The repository size grew to ~185.42 MiB by Week 4, primarily due to intermediate outputs and large directories.

### Suggestions
1. Use feature branches for experimental changes to avoid cluttering the main branch.
2. Regularly clean up results directories to minimize repository size.

## Overall Assessment

Overall, a OK job. 

You exhibited steady growth in technical skills, project management, and documentation throughout the coursework. 

Some of your scripts did retain errors. Try to be a little more vigilant in chasing down errors in future. Your commenting is very thorough, perhaps a little too much so, but this is also likely to be a tendency that fixes itself with experience.

It was a tough set of weeks, but I believe your hard work in them has given you a great start towards further training, a quantitative masters dissertation, and ultimately a career in quantitative biology!
