# My CMEE Coursework Repository

This repository is to submit the author's CMEE coursework. It contains the in-class practices and praticals from **The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist** online book https://themulquabio.github.io/TMQB/intro.html.

All codes in this project were written in and tested with bash terminal of Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS, Python 3.12.3 and R 4.4.1.

## Usage
